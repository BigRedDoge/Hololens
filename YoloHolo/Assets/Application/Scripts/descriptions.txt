Services/YoloV8Item.cs: Calculates box coordinates and class probabilities for a single image

Services/YoloItem.cs: Contains the class definition for a single YOLO item - a bounding box with class probabilities

Services/TensorExtensions.cs:
    - ProcessV8Item method: input - tensor and class translator
        for each item in tensor, if item has confidence above threshold, add most likely class and remove overlapping boxes
    - GetYoloData method: input - tensor, YoloClassTranslator
        calls ProcessV8Item and returns list of YoloItems

Services/YoloVersion.cs: Enum for a YOLO version

Services/YoloProcessorProfile.cs: Profile for YOLO processor
    - can set confidence threshold, overlap threshold, YoloClassTranslator, and YoloVersion

Services/YoloProcessor: Contains the class definition for a YOLO processor
    - RecognizeObjects method: input - 2d texture of camera frame
        converts texture to tensor, calls model task, gets yolo data (from GetYoloData tensor extension), and returns Task list of YoloItems

YoloLabeling/YoloObjectLabler.cs: Contains the class definition for a YOLO object labeler
    - fields for camera fps, yolo size, other settings
    - Start method: starts camera and IYoloProcessor service and StartRecognizingAsync method
    - StartRecognizingAsync Task method: gets camera frame, calls yolo on frame (RecognizeObjects method in YoloProcessor), and labels objects (ShowRecognitions)
    - ShowRecognitions method: draws class names on frame

What to do for segmentation:
- ✅ Create new YoloVersion version for segmentation
- Create new YoloSegementationItem.cs that handles calculating segmentation masks and class probabilities
- Create YoloSegmentationItem that contains the class definition for mask and class probabilities 
- ✅ Add GetYoloSegmentationData and ProcessSegmentationItem to TensorExtensions.cs
- Update ShowRecognitions in YoloObjectLabler to draw segmentation masks
- Create new YoloGameObject class for segmentation masks
- ✅ Remove RemoveOverlappingBoxes from FindMostLikelyObject in TensorExtensions.cs
